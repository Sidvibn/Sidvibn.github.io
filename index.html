								<b>Orbital Dynamics</b><br>Theoretically investigated the effects of Planet-Star interactions on the excitation of planetary obliquities.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Dynamics of ultra-hot Jupiter Atmospheres</b><br>Studied the dynamics of hot Jupiter atmospheres using well-balancing methods. Initialized isothermal and isentropic atmospheres on Python, and used Athena++ to look at their evolution.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Giant Planet Seismology</b><br>In the summer of 2023, I worked on giant-planet seismology. I looked at the effects of the rotation of Jupiter on its internal modes of oscillation and studied their gravitational perturbations on the satellite Juno. The simulations were carried out using REBOUND, while the modes were calculated using Python and GYRE.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Accretion Disks</b><br>Previously, I had worked on white dwarf eccentric disks. We were trying to see if it was possible to hold a stable eccentric disk around a white dwarf, assuming the incoming source was at a high eccentricity (e>0.9). The hydrodynamic simulations were carried out using Athena++, while the orbital and physical parameters were calculated using Python.
